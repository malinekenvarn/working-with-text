# working-with-text
For the course in web accessibility we did this lab to learn how to make readible text for the web

I added two fonts from Google fonts: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a>
The text and images was provided by the teachers, the task was to make it look readible in a web browser.
